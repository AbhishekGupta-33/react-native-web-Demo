This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till the "Creating a new application" step before proceeding.

## Step 1: Install Dependencies

Install all required dependencies using:

```bash
npm i --force
```

> ⚠️ The `--force` flag is used to resolve potential dependency conflicts.

## Step 2: Start the Metro Server

Metro is the JavaScript bundler that ships with React Native. Start it with:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

Let Metro run in its own terminal window.

## Step 3: Run the Application

Open a **new terminal** in the root directory of your project.

### For Android

Make sure you have an Android emulator running or a device connected.

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For Web

If your project is set up with Webpack for web support:

```bash
npm run webpack
```

Once Webpack starts, open your browser and navigate to:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

> ✅ Ensure `webpack.config.js` and related web support files are correctly configured for your project.

## Step 4: Modifying Your App

You can now start editing the app:

1. Open `App.tsx` in your preferred text editor.
2. Make any desired changes.

### Hot Reloading Instructions

- **Android**: Press <kbd>R</kbd> twice or use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (Windows/Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (macOS) to access the Developer Menu and reload.
- **iOS**: Press <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in the iOS Simulator.
- **Web**: Changes will hot-reload automatically in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
